RML - ML modules as ML modules with subtyping.
===

RML mixes ML Records and ML modules in a single type called recursive records with dependent types. RML is simple lambda-calculus with subtyping and parametric polymorphism, recursive type, record and dependent type.

```
module String = { type t = Nothing }
